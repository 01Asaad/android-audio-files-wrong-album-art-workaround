# android-audio-files-wrong-album-art-workaround
most music apps in Android show the album art of a random song in the album for all the songs in that album (sometimes the whole folder) instead of showing each song's embedded album art. This script changes every song's album name to be the same as the song's name so that music players show the embedded album art of each song.

If you care about having the correct album name of your songs, you can't use this script. (But at the same time you won't have this issue)

# How to use
  - set the correct directory name of your songs
  - run the script
  - rescan the media library and then clear your music player's cache (you can use a third party app to scan the media library
